## Description

`routesong.py` is a python3 script that can generate a route through
a graph of words with a specified musical metre.

The given word graph and metre are specified using CSV files.  Both
are hard-coded into the python script within the first 40 lines of
code.

An example graph (CCP Games' Eve Online solar systems) is saved in
`/DATA/graph/`. Example metres are saved in `/DATA/metre/`.

The script was written to be executed by Python version 3.5.3.

The script uses the following extra python packages:
