Lyrics:

(warp drive)
(warp, warp drive)
 

warp drive (active)
cargohold packed with big fat lyrical bombs
I'm the captain of the best ship in the universe
it was built by my space friends around the world,
the friend ship takes me where I need to go,
it can fly super fast or bounce really slow,
it's gotta lot of room for my homies in the back,
it's a fact I can dance all alone to this track,
that's why we fly
around the galaxy
X up for the fleet if you wanna party
 

setting course for the club,
paging the pleasure hub,
like it or not,
we're about to drop hot
when I say four, you warp to the dancefloor
one, two, three, four
 

WARP to the dancefloor
put your motherfucking hands in the air like this and
WARP to the dancefloor,
jump around all night with your space friends
WARP to the dancefloor
carry on all night, pleasure hub is all right
WARP to the dancefloor,
jump up, jump up for the Permaband
 

our flagship is the friendship,
get your feet on the floor and defend it
show up, gun cocked, target locked, take the shot
never hesitate, never give a second thought,
ship up, capsuleer comes clear, no fear,
come grab a beer, all your best friends are here,
even that alpha clone that quit last year
good lord, we don't know where we go aftershow
stick with the fleet, go with the flow,
try to keep up to the best of your ability
until we all collapse like a wave of probability
 

(warp) to the dancefloor,
put your motherfucking hands in the air like this and
WARP to the dancefloor,
jump arround all night with your space friends,
WARP to the dancefloor,
carry on all night, pleasure hub is all right,
WARP to the dancefloor,
jump up, jump up for the Permaband,
WARP to the dancefloor,
put your motherfucking hands in the air like this and
WARP to the dancefloor,
Permaband is back overheatin' every rack
WARP to the dancefloor,
undock, chin up wubalubadubdub,
WARP to the dancefloor,
hands up high for the friendship,
hands up high for the friendship,
hands up high for the friendship
